========================================
FINAL FIX - Repository Already Has Files
========================================

The problem: Your GitHub repository already has some files
(probably README, .gitignore, or license created during setup)

SOLUTION: Pull and merge, then push
========================================

Copy and paste these commands ONE BY ONE:

1. Pull the remote files and allow unrelated histories:
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

2. If you get a merge editor (vim), press:
   :wq
   (colon, w, q, then Enter)

3. Now push your code:
   git push -u origin main


========================================
COMPLETE COMMAND SEQUENCE
========================================

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main


========================================
ALTERNATIVE: Force Push (Overwrites Remote)
========================================

If you want to REPLACE everything on GitHub with your local code:

git push -u origin main --force


⚠️ WARNING: This will delete any files that exist on GitHub!
Only use this if you're sure you want to overwrite the remote.


========================================
RECOMMENDED: Use the Pull Method
========================================

This is safer and will merge any existing files:

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main


========================================
